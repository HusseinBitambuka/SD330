        <u>
            <h2 class="veryImportant"> The six process of cognition</h2>
        </u>
        <div id style="background-color: green;color: white;">
            <h2 clas="veryImportant ">Attention</h2>
            <p>Attention involves selecting what to focus on at a given time from a range of other possibilites.</p>
            <u><h3>Desing implications:</h3></u>
            <P>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider Context</li>
                    <li>Use techniques to achieve attention when designing visual interfaces, such as animated graphics,
                        color, underlining, ordering of items, sequencing of different information, and spacing of items
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid cluttering visual interfaces with too much information
                    </li>
                    <li>Consider designing different ways of supporting effective switching and returning to a particular interface</li>
                </ul>
            </P>

        <div style="background-color: blue;color: white;">
            <h2>Perception</h2>
            <p> Perception refers to how information is acquired from the environment via the five sense organs and transofrmed into experiences of objects, events, sounds, and tastes</p>
            <u><h3>Desing implications:</h3></u>
            <ul>
            <li>Design icons and other graphical representations between them.</li>
                <li>Obvious separators and white space are effective visual methods for grouping
                    information that make it easier to perceive and locate items.
                </li>
                <li>Design audio sounds to readily distinguishable from another so that users can perceive how they differ and remember what each one
                    represents.
                </li>
                <li>Research proper color contrast techniques when designing an interface, especilly when 
                    choosing a color for text so that it stands out from the background.
                </li>
                <li>Heptic feedback should be used judiciously</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: brown;color: white;">
            <h2>Memory</h2>
            <p> Memory involves recalling various kinds of knowledge that allow people to react appropriately</p>
            <u><h3>Desing implications:</h3></u>
            <ol>
                <li>Reduce cognitive load by avoiding long and complicated procedures for carrying out tasks</li>
                <li>Desing interfaces that promoted reconginiton rather than recall by using familiar interaction patterns, menu, icons, and consinstely placed objects.</li>
                <li>Provide users with a variety of ways of labeling digital information to help them easily identify it again through the use of folders, categories, color, time stamping, and icons</li>
            </ol>
                
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: yellow;color: white;">
            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p>Learning involves accumulation of skills and knowledge that be impossible to achieve without memory</p>
            <p>Cognitive psychologists group learnig into incidental and intentional learnig:
                <ol>
                    <li>Incidental learning occurs without any intentio to learn.</li>
                    <li>Intentional learning is goal-directed with the goal of being able to remember it</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <u><h3>Desing implications:</h3></u>
            <ol>
                <li>Design interfaces that encourage exploration.</li>
                <li>Design interfaces that constrain and guide users to select appropriate action when initially learning</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: grey;color: white;">
            <h2>Reading, speaking, and listening</h2>
            <p>Reading, speaking, and listening are three forms of language processing that have some similar and some different properties.
                One similarity is that the meaning of sentences or phrases remains the same regardless of the mode in which its conveyed
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep the lenght of speech-based menus and instructions to a minimum.</li>
                <li>Accentuate the intonation of artificilly generated speech voices, as they are harder to understand than human voice.</li>
                <li>Provide opportunities for making text large on scree, without affect for people who find it hard to read small text.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Problem-solving, planing, reasoning, and decision-making</h2>
            <p> Problem-solving, planning, reasoning, and decision-making are processes involving reflective cognition. They include thinking about what to do, what the available options ard, and what the consequences might be of carrying out a given action.</p>
            <u><h3>Desing implications:</h3></u>
            <ol>
                <li>Provide information and help pages that are easy to access for people who want to understand more about how to carry out an activity more effectively</li>
                <li>Use simple and memorable functions to support rapid decision-making and planning</li>
