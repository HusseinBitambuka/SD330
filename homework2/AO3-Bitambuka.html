                    Both ebook and paperback book use the concepts of pages and paragraphs, and the paper-based map and the digital map use
                    the same concepts of north, south, east, west, equator, and meridian.<br>

                    The paper-based based artifacts have given the digital apps the concepts <br>
                    The new functionality that comes with the digital app is the ability to zoom the content.<br>
