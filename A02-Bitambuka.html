        <h1>Homework__Chapter 2</h1>
        <h2>1. What are the 'double diamond approach?' What are the four phasesand a short description of each phase?</h2>
        <p>The double diamond approach is the name given to the commonalities of the various disciplines of design <br>
        The approach has four phases: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Discover: this is a phase where designers try to gather information about the problem</li>
            <li>Define: this is a phase where designers develop a clear brief that frames the design challenge</li>
            <li>Develop: this is a phase where solutions or concepts are created, prototyped, tested, and iterated</li>
            <li>Deliver: this is a phase where the final solution is produced and launched</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>2. What are Dan Saffer's four approaches to interaction design- and a short description of each? which approach suits your software development style best?</h2>
        <P>
            Dan Saffer four approaches to interaction design are:
            <ul>
                <li>User-centered design:this is the approch in which the user guide the designer on what to design. in other words, the designer's job is to translate the users'needs and goals onto a design solution.</li>
                <li>Activity-centered design: this approach focuses on the behavior surrounding particular tasks. Users play a significant role, but it is their behavior rather than their goals and needs that is important</li>
                <li>System design: this approach is structured, rigorous, and holistic. It focuses on the c
                    context and is particularly  appropriate for complex problems.
                </li>
                <li>Genius design: This approach is different from the previous ones in that it relies on the experience and creative flair of a designer.</li>
            </ul>
        </P>
        <P> <b>The  approach that suits my software development style best is the User-centered approach</b></P>
        <h2>3. What is "cooperative design" and how does it fit in with what you know about Agile?</h2>
        <p>Cooperative design, also sometimes refer to as participatory design or co-design, is a design philosophy that places
            those for whom systems, technologies, and services are designed,as central actors in creation activities. The idea is that instead of being
            passive receivers of new technological and industrial artifacts, end users and 
            stake holders are active participants in the design process.
        </p>
        <p>Since agile methodology is the process of managing a big project by breaking it into smaller parts and involving constant collaboration with stakeholders to improve the product iteratively, this philosophy of co-design fits the methodology very well.

        <h2>4. What are Gloud & Lewis' three key principles of HCI?</h2>
        <P>
            <ol>
                <li>Early focs on users and tasks: this means understanding who the users 
                    will be by directly studyng their cognitive, behavioral, anthropomorphic, and
                    attitudianl characteristic.
                </li>
                <li>Empirical measurement: Early in development, the reactions and performance of intended usersto printed scenarios, manuals, and so forth, are observed and 
                    measured. Later, users interact with simulations and prototypes, and 
                    their perfomence and reactions are observed, recorded, and analyzed.
                </li>
                <li>Iterative design: When problems are found in user testing, they are fixed,and then more tests and observations are carried out to see the effects of the fixes. </li>
            </ol>
        </P>
        <h2>5. What are the four basic activities of interaction design?</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
            <li>Discovering requirements for the interactive product.</li>
            <li>Designing alternatives that meet those requirements.</li>
            <li>Prototyping the alternative designs so that they can be communicated and assessed</li>
            <li>Evaluating the product and the user experience it offers throughout the process.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>6. Look at Activity 2.5 and analyze NETFLIX for the six listed characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Effectiveness: NETFLIX is very effective in that it is available in 190 countries.
                Unlike most movie industries that are mostly available in the US and Europe, NETFLIX is able to satify its customers in various countries in all the continents.

            </li>
            <li>Efficiency: NETFLIX is very efficinet because all the movies are easily accessible just by clicking</li>
            <li>Safety: NETFLIX is a very safe platform as it uses encryption to encrypt sensitive information like banking information or passwords.</li>
            <li>Utility: NETFLIX does not have a lot of functionalities, and all its functionalies are useful</li>
            <li>Learnability: NETFLIX is easier to use. One just has to click on the picture of a movie one wants to watch</li>
            <li>Thanks to the fact that it has few functionalies, NETFLIX is very easy to remember.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>7. jot down some notes you are prepared to discuss: " Dilemma: Too much of a good thing?"</h2>
    <p>
        involving the users is good as it gives the designer the idea of 
        how their system will affect the users, but the users should not entirely decide about the system.
        Since the system is designed to be used by as many users as possible, the disigner cannot encorporate everyone needs in the system. Therefore, users should be consulted before developing the system to give the designer the sense of problem the designer will be designing solution for and 
        after the product is designed to give feedback on how to serve them best.
        It is not appropriate for users to lead technical development project in that most of the users do not have
        the technical knowledge for that positions. However, the users are best at evaluating whether the product fits their needs or not.
